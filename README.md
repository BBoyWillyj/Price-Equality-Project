Extract Item Prices from Meeting Notes
Task: Use regex to extract the item prices (in dollars) from the meeting notes.
Goal: Identify and list all dollar amounts mentioned in the text.
Example: Extract $1200.99, $85.50, etc., from the meeting notes.
Concepts Used: Regex for currency, number matching, capturing groups.

That is the main part.
The document would contain an item, the item
quantity and it's price. I'm looking forward to extracting an item and 
its respective details from both documents and comparing them to
find similarities. For now i've only done prices.
Looking forward to collaborations
